## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

## Some basic EDA

- How many candidates running for what offices?

```{r}
candidates %>%
  group_by(cand_election_yr, cand_office, cand_office_state) %>%
  summarize(num_candidates = n()) %>%
  print(n = Inf)
```

Note that this appears to be cumulative!

- How many committees [by type](https://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/CommitteeTypeCodes.shtml)?

```{r}
committees %>%
  group_by(cmte_type) %>%
  summarize(num_committees = n(), 
            cand_ids = sum(cand_id > "")) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_committees))
```

- What types of contributions are there and where do they go?

```{r}
contributions %>%
  group_by(entity_type) %>%
  summarize(num_contributions = n(), 
            total_amount = sum(transaction_amt), 
            other_ids = sum(other_id > ""),
            cand_ids = sum(cand_id > "")) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_contributions))
```
